For this project, I worked with live stock market data from an API, focusing on NVIDIA (NVDA).

## 💡 The challenge?
The raw data was messy, unstructured, and needed proper shaping before analysis.

This meant I had to:
1. Extract the live stock data from the API
2. Select the Meta column and unpivot the others
3. Remove the unnecessary Meta data column
4. Split the Attribute column by delimiter
5. Drop irrelevant Attribute 1 and Attribute 2 columns
6. Clean the dataset by removing the first 4 rows
7. Replace values so I could pivot without aggregating
8. Add a custom column for the stock symbol
9. Rename the query to represent the stock (NVDA)


## 🔑 What the Data Revealed:

• Live daily stock prices of NVIDIA (NVDA)
• Structured attributes for analysis: Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume
• Ready-to-use data model for creating interactive visuals and tracking market movements


## 📌 Key Visuals in the Dashboard:

• Stock price trend over time
• Daily Open vs. Close comparisons
• High vs. Low movement patterns
• Volume trends with filters
• Interactive slicers to select timeframes

## ✨ Takeaway:
This project showed me how Power Query transformations can clean and reshape raw API data into a structured format ready for analysis. For financial analysts and traders, this means smarter tracking of stock performance, clearer insights, and faster decision-making.

What would you have done differently if you were handling this stock data?
