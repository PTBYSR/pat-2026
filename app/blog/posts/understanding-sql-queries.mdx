When working with data, everything starts with a simple idea:
You have a question, and the data has the answer.

But how do you ask the database that question?

That's where SQL queries come in.

## What Is an SQL Query?

Your data lives inside **tables**.
Those tables live inside a **database**.

If you want to know something like:

- What are the total sales this year?
- Which customers spent more than $1,000?
- How many users signed up last month?

You need to talk to the database using its language — **SQL (Structured Query Language)**.

An SQL query is simply a request you write in SQL to retrieve data from the database.

The most basic and important query is the `SELECT` statement.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales;
```

This tells the database:

> "Give me everything from the sales table."

When you run (execute) this query:

1. The database receives it.
2. The DBMS processes it.
3. It fetches the requested data.
4. It sends the result back to you.

**Important:**
A `SELECT` query does not modify data.
It only reads and retrieves data.

## SQL Query Clauses Explained

SQL queries are built using different sections called **clauses**.
Each clause has a specific role.

Think of clauses as tools that help you shape your question properly.

### 1️⃣ SELECT – Choose What You Want

The `SELECT` clause defines which columns you want to retrieve.

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM customers;
```

This retrieves only the `name` and `age` columns.

If you use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

The asterisk (`*`) means **all columns**.

**Best practice:**
Avoid `SELECT *` in production systems. It retrieves unnecessary data and may slow performance.

### 2️⃣ FROM – Where the Data Comes From

The `FROM` clause tells SQL which table to get the data from.

```sql
SELECT name FROM customers;
```

Here, `customers` is the source table.

Without `FROM`, SQL doesn't know where to look.

### 3️⃣ WHERE – Filter Data Before Aggregation

The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on a condition.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE age > 18;
```

This retrieves only customers older than 18.

`WHERE` works on the **original data**, before grouping or aggregation.

### 4️⃣ ORDER BY – Sort Results

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set.

```sql
SELECT name, score
FROM players
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

- **ASC** → Ascending (default)
- **DESC** → Descending

You can also sort using multiple columns (nested ordering):

```sql
ORDER BY country ASC, score DESC;
```

This sorts first by country, then by score within each country.

### 5️⃣ GROUP BY – Aggregate Data

`GROUP BY` is used when you want to summarize data.

**Example:** Find total sales per country.

```sql
SELECT country, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM customers
GROUP BY country;
```

This combines rows with the same country and calculates total sales.

⚠️ **Important Rule:**
Every column in `SELECT` must either:

- Be inside an aggregate function (like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
- Or be included in the `GROUP BY`

### 6️⃣ HAVING – Filter After Aggregation

`HAVING` filters grouped results.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT country, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM customers
GROUP BY country
HAVING SUM(sales) > 10000;
```

**Difference between WHERE and HAVING:**

- `WHERE` filters raw rows
- `HAVING` filters aggregated results

You cannot use `HAVING` without `GROUP BY`.

### 7️⃣ DISTINCT – Remove Duplicates

`DISTINCT` ensures only unique values appear.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM customers;
```

This removes repeated country values.

⚠️ **Performance Tip:**
Use `DISTINCT` only when necessary. It forces extra processing.

### 8️⃣ TOP / LIMIT – Restrict Number of Rows

Sometimes you don't want all results.

SQL Server uses:

```sql
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM customers;
```

MySQL and PostgreSQL use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
LIMIT 5;
```

This improves performance when you only need a preview.

## The Correct Order of Writing an SQL Query

SQL has a strict structure. If you don't follow it, you'll get an error.

**Writing Order (Coding Order):**

1. `SELECT`
2. `DISTINCT`
3. `TOP`
4. columns
5. `FROM`
6. `WHERE`
7. `GROUP BY`
8. `HAVING`
9. `ORDER BY`

**Example putting everything together:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT TOP 2
  col1
FROM customers
WHERE year = 2024
GROUP BY country
HAVING SUM(sales) > 5000
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

## But Here's Something More Interesting…

Even though we write queries starting with `SELECT`,
SQL actually **executes** them in a different logical order:

1. `FROM`
2. `WHERE`
3. `GROUP BY`
4. `HAVING`
5. `SELECT`
6. `ORDER BY`

Understanding this helps explain why:

- You cannot use column aliases in `WHERE`
- `HAVING` works only after grouping

This is where SQL becomes more than syntax — it becomes **logic**.

## Final Thoughts

An SQL query is simply a structured way of asking the database a question.

But mastering SQL means understanding:

- How to retrieve data efficiently
- How filtering works before and after aggregation
- How grouping transforms data
- How execution order affects results
- How performance is impacted by your choices

Once you understand these concepts,
you're no longer just writing queries.

**You're thinking like a data engineer.**
